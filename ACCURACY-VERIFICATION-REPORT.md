- Peak days can have 700+ transactions requiring multiple API pages

### Data Integrity
- All revenue amounts match to the penny
- Check counts match exactly
- Historical data from Sep 2023 to Aug 2025 is complete

## Technical Implementation

### Verification Method
```javascript
// For each date:
1. Query Toast API with pagination (100 records/page)
2. Sum only non-voided, paid checks
3. Compare with database actual_revenue
4. Update if mismatch > $0.01
```

### API Considerations
- Toast API requires pagination for busy days
- Some days have 8+ pages of data (800+ orders)
- Rate limiting requires delays between requests

## Recommendations

1. **Automated Verification**: Run monthly verification to ensure ongoing accuracy
2. **Real-time Sync**: Consider implementing webhook-based updates
3. **Audit Trail**: Log all revenue corrections with timestamps
4. **Alert System**: Notify when daily revenue exceeds thresholds
