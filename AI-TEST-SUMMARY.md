# AI Chat Test Summary

## 🎯 Critical Tests That MUST Pass

### 1. Exact Date Queries
- ✅ "August 1st" → $1,295.00 (NOT $4,489.12 which includes Aug 2)
- ✅ "August 8" → $1,440.06
- ✅ "August 9" → $343.80
- ✅ "August 10" → $2,040.00

### 2. Relative Date Queries
- ✅ "yesterday" → $343.80 (Aug 9)
- ✅ "today" → $2,040.00 (Aug 10)
- ✅ "2 days ago" → $1,440.06 (Aug 8)

### 3. Month vs Day Disambiguation
- ✅ "August" → Full month data (NOT just Aug 1)
- ✅ "August revenue" → Full month (NOT $1,295.00)
- ✅ "August 1st" → ONLY Aug 1 ($1,295.00)

## 📋 All Test Categories

### Date Format Variations
- August 1st, August 1, Aug 1, 8/1, 8/1/2025, 08/01/2025, 2025-08-01
- 1st of August, 1 August, Thursday August 1

### Relative Dates
- today, yesterday, tomorrow, X days ago, last week, this week

### Day of Week
- last Thursday, this Friday, Saturday revenue, weekend totals

### Time Periods
- this week, last week, this month, last month, YTD, QTD, MTD
- August 1-10, last 7 days, past 30 days

### Business Metrics
- average check size, check count, orders per day, revenue per hour
- peak hours, busiest days, trends, growth rates

### Comparisons
- today vs yesterday, this week vs last week, August 1 vs August 8
- week over week, month over month, year over year

### Statistical Queries
- best day, worst day, average daily revenue, median revenue
- standard deviation, quartiles, outliers

### Edge Cases
- future dates (graceful failure)
- invalid dates (August 99)
- missing data (August 3-7)
- ambiguous queries (needs clarification)

### Security Tests
- SQL injection attempts
- XSS attempts
- Path traversal
- Code injection

### Natural Language
- typos and misspellings
- casual language ("yesterday's take")
- excessive punctuation
- emojis and unicode

### Complex Queries
- multiple dates in one query
- calculations and math
- conditional logic
- multi-dimensional analysis

## ⚠️ Known Issues to Fix

1. **Date Parsing Order** - Must check "August 1st" pattern before "August" pattern
2. **Single Day Queries** - Must use same start/end date (not next day)
3. **Time Zone** - Currently assumes business local time
4. **Missing Data** - August 3-7 have no data (need clear messaging)

## 🔒 Security Requirements

- Block all SQL injection attempts
- Sanitize inputs before processing  
- No code execution possibilities
- Rate limiting on API calls
- Input length limits

## 📊 Performance Requirements

- Response time < 3 seconds
- Handle concurrent requests
- Cache frequent queries
- Limit date ranges to reasonable periods

## ✅ Validation Checklist

Before deployment, ensure:
- [ ] August 1st returns exactly $1,295.00
- [ ] "August" returns monthly data, not single day
- [ ] Yesterday/today work correctly
- [ ] Invalid dates return helpful errors
- [ ] SQL injection is blocked
- [ ] All amounts match database exactly
- [ ] Missing data is clearly indicated
- [ ] Response time is acceptable
