## Quick Security Fixes

### 1. Add Security Headers (5 minutes)
Create `vercel.json`:
```json
{
  "headers": [
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "headers": [
        { "key": "X-Content-Type-Options", "value": "nosniff" },
        { "key": "X-Frame-Options", "value": "DENY" },
        { "key": "X-XSS-Protection", "value": "1; mode=block" }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### 2. Basic Rate Limiting (15 minutes)
```typescript
const rateLimitMap = new Map();

export function rateLimit(req: Request, limit = 10, window = 60000) {
  const ip = req.headers.get('x-forwarded-for') || 'unknown';
  const now = Date.now();
  const requests = rateLimitMap.get(ip) || [];
  const recentRequests = requests.filter((time: number) => now - time < window);
  
  if (recentRequests.length >= limit) {
    throw new Error('Rate limit exceeded');
  }
  
  recentRequests.push(now);
  rateLimitMap.set(ip, recentRequests);
}
```

### 3. Input Sanitization (10 minutes)
```typescript
import DOMPurify from 'isomorphic-dompurify';

export const sanitize = (input: string): string => {
  return DOMPurify.sanitize(input, { ALLOWED_TAGS: [] });
};
```

### 4. API Key Validation (10 minutes)
```typescript
export async function validateApiKey(req: Request) {
  const apiKey = req.headers.get('x-api-key');
  
  if (!apiKey || apiKey !== process.env.API_KEY) {
    throw new Error('Invalid API key');
  }
}
```
