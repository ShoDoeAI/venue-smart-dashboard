# ðŸ”§ Fix Toast Data for Jack's on Water Street

## The Problem
Your current `dashboard.js` is showing **yesterday's** data instead of **today's** data. This is why you see $0 on weekdays - it's showing yesterday (when you were closed), not today.

## Quick Fix - Choose One:

### Option 1: Use the Accurate Dashboard (Recommended)
```bash
# Replace dashboard.js with the accurate version
cp api/dashboard-accurate.js api/dashboard.js
```

### Option 2: Test First
```bash
# Test the accurate dashboard locally
curl http://localhost:3000/api/dashboard-accurate
```

## What dashboard-accurate.js Shows:
- âœ… **Today's revenue** (real-time)
- âœ… **Yesterday's revenue** 
- âœ… **Last weekend revenue** (Fri-Sun)
- âœ… **Last 7 days total**
- âœ… **Restaurant name** (Jack's on Water Street)
- âœ… **Menu items** from your restaurant

## Deploy the Fix:
```bash
# After replacing dashboard.js
git add -A
git commit -m "Fix dashboard to show today's data instead of yesterday's"
git push
vercel --prod
```

## Verify It's Working:
1. Visit: https://venue-smart-dashboard.vercel.app/api/dashboard
2. Check that it shows:
   - Restaurant name: "Jack's on Water Street"
   - Today's data (not yesterday's)
   - Accurate weekend revenue

## Why This Happened:
The original dashboard.js was coded to show yesterday's data, assuming you'd want to see complete day data. But since you're only open weekends, this meant weekday dashboards always showed $0.

## The Fix:
`dashboard-accurate.js` shows:
- Today's data (live, up to current moment)
- Plus historical data for context
- Correctly identifies your restaurant
